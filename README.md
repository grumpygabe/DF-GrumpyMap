Custom 7 days to die map for Darkness Falls

This is a basic 6k custom map for Darkness Falls.
It does not include CompoPack POIs.  It does include one special POI that is probably not meaningful outside of the group I play with.

It was designed with a few requirements:
1) Darkness Falls POIs are placed in appropriate locations.
2) Limited spawns - all players start central to the map and with the same started trader (good for small groups meeting up).
3) Small map with a relatively high city/town density.
3) Interesting topography to build on.

Why would you use this map?
- It is easy for a small group to meet up at the same trader.
- Players will always spawn with a quest giving trader as their first quest. 
- Vanilla traders are somewhat evenly distributed throughout the map.
- The road network is pretty good.  

Problems?
- I modified the roads a bit on this, and there are some issues.  Some of them are a little bumpy.  
  Sometimes rock outcrops spawn right in the middle of them.  The apocalypse can be hazardous in many ways.  But it is better than no roads.
- The wasteland is relatively small.  This might adversely affect endgame play.  
  If you're expecting a ton of variety in tier 5 POIs out there, you might be disappointed.
